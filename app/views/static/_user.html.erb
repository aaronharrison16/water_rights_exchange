        <h3>What We Do</h3>

        <p class="lead">
          Utah Water Right Exchange was created to provide information for the sale of
          individual water rights, so a market price can be determined. Using this
          information, we hope to find a buyer and seller that are both satisfied when the sale
          is complete.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          The listing is non-exclusive so if you find a buyer outside the website no commission will be
          required. You may enter your own listing information or call me and I will enter it for you.
          When there is an inquiry about your water right it will come to me to negotiate the sale. It will
          not come directly to you. If I successfully negotiate a sale and act as the broker in completing
          the sale a commission will be charged. The typical commission will be 6% for irrigation
          company shares or 10% for underground water right sales where a change of location is required.
        </p>
