This application is intended to serve as a water right brokerage for the state of Utah. The workflow of the application is set up so a user can create an account to begin creating posts for water rights that they wish to buy/sell. The site administrator will then look at the posting and choose whether or not he wants to accept the user as a client. Once the post is accepted, the admin then has all of the postings under his name for users of the site to contact him and they can come to an agreement from there for the water right.
